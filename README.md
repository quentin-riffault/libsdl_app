# libsdl_app
Dynamic library used to manage SDL projects that use a game loop. 
No need to write the same lines of code again and again, as everything is handled by the app constructor.

## Requirements
- SDL2
- make

## Installation
Use `make test` to build everything in the test folder of your choice (change it by updating the Makefile) or `make deploy` to install the lib (default in /usr/lib/).
